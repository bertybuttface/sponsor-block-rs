A Rust wrapper for the [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) API, which you
can find complete documentation for [here](https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/w/API_Docs).

Please see the [SponsorBlock Database and API License](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/wiki/Database-and-API-License)
for more information.

This library is still missing many features of the full API, but it contains many
segment-retrieval functions necessary for use of the service.
